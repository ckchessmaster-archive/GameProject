# GameEngine
The Repo is for both a game engine that I am building and a game to go along with it. The engine is designed to be as minimal as possible and leave most decisions up to the game developer. 

The following depndancies must be downloaded and placed in the main project folder in order to compile:
<ul>
  <li>SFML 2.4.2</li>
</ul>
